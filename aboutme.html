            <h3>About Yu</h3>
            <p>My name is Yu Nandar Aung. I am now studying computer programming at Saint Paul College. It’s been only 4 months since I arrived in the United States by the time I’m writing this. So, everything is great and new for me. America has everything and things which we never imagined having in Burma such as human rights, freedom, quality of life and snow. I feel a lot safer here even though there are gun violence as I used to live in the fear of having no future, being arrested or killed for saying the truth, losing properties because the military can burn our houses or raid anytime.  </p>
            <p>Moreover, I am so glad I got a chance to be in Susan’s HTML/CSS class. I had zero knowledge of programming, and I don’t even know how many times I thought to change the major because I thought this was something beyond my ability. But I’ve found Susan’s class to be fun and super interesting and I feel like I am doing great when it comes to HTML, and it encouraged me to keep trying and gave me confidence. Thank you so much, Susan, for making the challenging class to be easier and always supporting your students. </p>

    <p>Let me conclude this with a poem written by Than Toe Aung, an activist who escaped Burma and now is in the United States. Let the poem say everything I want to say.<p>
    <div class="poem">
     <h3>Letter To My Parents in Burma</h3>
     <p>"Hello May May and Ba Ba</p>
     <p>How is the military government treating you?</p>
     <p>Are they still trying to kill my activist friends?</p>
     <p>Are they still looking for me?</p>
     <p>Does the sound of the gunshots at 2am still frighten you?</p>
     <p>Or are they now just the background noises?</p>
     <p>Are you still having nightmares, Mom</p>
     <p>Is everyone safe?</p>
     <p>If you need me,</p>
     <p>I'm only an ocean away.</p>
     <p>I'm okay. Don't worry.</p>
     <p>Those green ghosts can't haunt me anymore.</p>
     <p>Here in America, I don't have to hide.</p>
     <p>I only have to worry about my tuition fees</p>
     <p>I miss you</p>
     <p>From my petite and overpriced</p>
     <p>(but very safe) bedroom in America."</p>
